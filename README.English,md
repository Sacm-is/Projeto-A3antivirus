Academic Antivirus
A basic antivirus for learning purposes, developed in Java during the ADS course

Description:

This project aims to demonstrate the basic concepts of antivirus development. It scans a specific directory, searching for files with names matching a predefined list.

Technologies:

Java: Main programming language.
Swing: GUI library for the user interface.
Eclipse: Integrated development environment used.
Features:

File name search: Checks if file names match a predefined list of suspicious names.
Graphical interface: Displays scan results in a table.
Limitations:

Basic detection: Performs a quick search for suspicious files in a specific directory.
Fixed directory: The scan is performed in a predefined directory, limiting the software's flexibility.
What's missing?

Real virus detection: Currently, the antivirus only checks file names. Advanced techniques to detect real threats need to be implemented.
More user-friendly interface: The current interface is basic. Additional features and improvements can enhance the user experience.
Automatic updates: It would be great if the antivirus could update itself automatically with new malicious file lists.
